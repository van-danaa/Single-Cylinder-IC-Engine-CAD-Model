# Single-Cylinder IC Engine CAD Model

## Overview
This project contains the 3D CAD model of a single-cylinder internal combustion engine, created in Fusion 360.  
The objective was to understand internal mechanisms through part modeling, assembly, and motion study.

## Tools & Technologies
- Autodesk Fusion 360

## Features
- Detailed modeling of piston, crankshaft, connecting rod, and cylinder block.
- Assembly with motion study to visualize mechanical interactions and tolerances.
